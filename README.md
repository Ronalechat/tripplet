# TTT
##### AKA Tic-Tac-Toe

## What is this?
This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If you would like to know more about the game, and its history, I suggest you visit
[this Wikipedia article on Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

## Rules
TTT is a two player game, one as the 'X', and the other as the 'O'. By default, 'O' has the first move. Each player has one move per turn. Each player's objective is to occupy three squares in a row with your symbol. If either player fails to occupy three squares by the ninth turn, it is considered a tie. Or a draw. No one wins.

Turns are made simply by clicking on any unoccupied square, marked by a "+".

## Win Conditions
Winning happens when one player's "X" or "O" occupy three squares in a single direction.
This can happen in any direction.

## Why?
This is a game made as an exercise in javascript as an assignment for General Assembly by Michael Lin. If you stake your claim in owning tic-tac-toe, you're probably a liar. This game was made as a practice in programming, as well as for the fun of it.
